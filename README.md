## Concept explanation
This movie poster for Lethal Company is designed to capture the essence of a horror survival film. It uses dark, eerie colors and graphic elements that create a sense of tension and danger. The film title stands out with bold, glitchy text, while the background shows scenes full of suspense with fading monsters.
